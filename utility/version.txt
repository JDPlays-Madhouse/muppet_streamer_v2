HOT FIXES
=========

logging-utils.lua > LoggingUtils.RunFunctionAndCatchErrors --- updated to make function generically useful. Added to Utility 20.12.46.
commands-utils.lua > CommandsUtils.CheckTableArgument() --- removed requirement that keys in the table are strings, as there's no reason for this blind requirement. Added to Utility 20.12.45.
