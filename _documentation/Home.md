Features that a streamer can let chat activate to make their games more dynamic and interactive. These features are more complicated than can be achieved via simple Lua scripting and are highly customisable within the command/remote interface calls.

Streamer Effects
================

Effects that a streamer can let chat activate to make their games more dynamic and interactive. All are done via highly configurable remote interface scripts and RCON commands as detailed for each feature.



#### Schedule Explosive Delivery

Schedule a highly customisable explosive delivery to the player at speed.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Schedule-Explosive-Delivery)

---------------------



#### Malfunctioning Weapon

A malfunctioning weapon that shoots wildly for short bursts intermittently.

---------------------



#### Give Weapon & Ammo

Give the player a weapon and ammo, plus options to force it as an active weapon.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Give-Weapon-&-Ammo)

#### Spawn Around Player

Spawn things around the player with various placement options.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Spawn-Around-Player)

---------------------



#### Aggressive Driver

Make the player an aggressive driver who has no or limited control of their vehicle.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Aggressive-Driver)

![demo](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/images/aggressive-driver.gif)

---------------------



#### Call For Help

Call other players for help by teleporting them in near you.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Call-For-Help)

---------------------



#### Teleport

Teleport the player to a range of possible target types.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Teleport)

---------------------



#### Pants On Fire

Sets the ground on fire behind a player.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Pants-On-Fire)

---------------------



#### Player Drop Inventory

Helper Functions
==============

Functions that streamers can use to build more complicated Lua code features. Blurring the possibilities between a Lua script and a mod.



#### Delayed Lua

Provides ways to schedule Lua code to be run at a later date and to manage these scheduled actions.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Delayed-Lua)

Feature rich examples [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Delayed-Lua#rich-features-using-delayed-lua):

- Biter Pet - A friendly biter that follows the player around and generally acts like a dog. Highly configurable and expandable if desired.

---------------------

---------------------

---------------------




Multiplayer Features
==============

Persistent features that can be controlled via mod settings and commands. All default to off.



#### Team Member Limit

Can add a team member limit GUI & research for use in Multiplayer by streamers.

Configuration details and examples: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Team-Member-Limit)

---------------------

---------------------

---------------------



Map Features
==============

Persistent features that are controlled via mod settings to allow streamers to control their game setup.



#### Dead Building Ghosts

Start the game with ghosts appearing when buildings die, rather than having to wait for a technology to unlock it (construction robotics).

A mod setting that can make all forces start with ghosts being placed upon entity deaths. Ideal if your chat blows up your base often early game and you freehand build, so don't have a blueprint to just paste down again.

This is the same as if the force had researched the vanilla Factorio construction robot technology to unlock it, by giving entity ghosts a long life time. The mod setting can be safely disabled post technology research if desired without it undoing any researched ghost life timer.

---------------------



#### All Units Can Open Gates

Makes all units able to open friendly gates, as by default biters can not. Useful when adding friendly biters to the player's team so these biters don't get stuck inside your walls and gates. As you'd surely microchip your beloved pets so they can transit your base perimeter smoothly.

---------------------



#### Game Starting Settings

Game settings that the mod provides an easy way to manage via mod settings.

- Disable introduction message in freeplay.
- Disable rocket win condition in freeplay.
- Set a custom area of the map revealed at game start.

---------------------

---------------------

---------------------



Utility Prototypes
==============

Helpful prototypes that can be useful when doing adhoc things for streams and integration effects.



#### Invisible Blocking Entities

Invisible blocking entities that can be used to block different entity types. e.g. block players from being able to build somewhere, or units being able to move/spawn in an area.

Usage details: [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Invisible-Blocking-Entities)

---------------------



Updating The Mod
===============

When updating the mod make sure there aren't any effects active or queued for action (in delay). As the mod is not kept backwards compatible when new features are added or changed. The chance of an effect being active when the mod is being updated seems very low given their usage, but you've been warned.

---------------------

---------------------

---------------------



Streamer Integration Scripts
===============

I have some more complex and bespoke streamer integration scripts publicly available. These provide neat features that are complicated enough they can't just be casually typed, but not complicated/important enough to warrant inclusion in a mod.

They are provided as scripts and not as part of a mod as some users will want to make changes to them to fit their specific play through or other mods in use. They may even want to remove or add features to the scripts. As a script I am able to develop them quicker in a lighter fashion than a modded feature as I don't have to cater for every edge case another mod could generate within them, you can amend them yourself for this.
