Schedule a highly customisable explosive delivery to the player at speed. The projectiles are created off the target player's screen and so take a few seconds to fly to their destinations.

# Options

Details on the options syntax is available on the [Streamer Effect Options Syntax Wiki page](https://github.com/muppet9010/factorio-muppet-streamer/wiki/Streamer-Effect-Options-Syntax).

| Option Name | Data Type | Required | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| delay | DECIMAL | Optional | How many seconds the effect will be delayed for before looking for the targets current position and creating the explosive. A `0` second `delay` makes it happen instantly. If not specified it defaults to happen instantly. This doesn't include the explosives in-flight time. |
| explosiveCount | INTEGER | Mandatory | The quantity of explosives to be delivered. |
| explosiveType | STRING | Mandatory | The type of explosive, can be any one of the vanilla Factorio built-in options: `grenade`, `clusterGrenade`, `slowdownCapsule`, `poisonCapsule`, `artilleryShell`, `explosiveRocket`, `atomicRocket`, `smallSpit`, `mediumSpit`, `largeSpit`, or `custom`. Is case sensitive. `custom` requires the additional options `customExplosiveType` and `customExplosiveSpeed` options to be set/considered. |
| customExplosiveType | STRING | Mandatory Special | Only required/supported if `explosiveType` is set to `custom`. Sets the name of the explosive to be used. Must be either a `projectile`, `artillery-projectile` or `stream` entity type. |
| customExplosiveSpeed | DECIMAL | Mandatory Special | Only required/supported if `explosiveType` is set to `custom`. Sets the speed of the custom explosive type in the air. Only applies to `projectile` and `artillery-projectile` entity types. Default is `0.3` if not specified. See effect Notes for the values of built-in options. |
| target | STRING | Mandatory | A player name to target the position and surface of (case sensitive). |
| targetPosition | POSITION | Optional | A specific position to target on the target player's surface, rather than the player's current position. See Argument Data Types for syntax examples of a POSITION. |
| targetOffset | POSITION | Optional | An offset position that's applied to the `target`/`targetPosition` value. By default there is no offset set. See Argument Data Types for syntax examples of a POSITION. |
| accuracyRadiusMin | DECIMAL | Optional | The minimum distance from the target that each explosive can be randomly targeted within. If not specified defaults to `0`. |
| accuracyRadiusMax | DECIMAL | Optional | The maximum distance from the target that each explosive can be randomly targeted within. If not specified defaults to `0`. |
| salvoSize | INTEGER | Optional | Breaks the incoming `explosiveCount` into salvos of this size. Useful if you are using very large numbers of nukes to prevent UPS issues. Defaults to all explosives being in a single salvo. |
| salvoDelay | INTEGER | Optional | Use when `salvoSize` is set. Sets the delay between each salvo deliveries in game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second). |
| salvoFollowPlayer | BOOLEAN | Optional | If each salvo re-targets on the player's current position and surface (`true`) or continues to target the initial position (`false`). Defaults to `false`, so any secondary salvo hits the `target` players initial position. |



# Syntax and Usage Examples

Note: all examples target the player named `muppet9010`, you will need to replace this with your own player's name.

#### Remote Interface

<details><summary>show details</summary>
<p>

Remote Interface Syntax: `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', [OPTIONS TABLE])`

The options must be provided as a Lua table.

Examples:

| Example | Code |
| --- | --- |
| grenades around player | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {explosiveCount=20, explosiveType="grenade", target="muppet9010", accuracyRadiusMin=7, accuracyRadiusMax=10})` |
| atomic rocket | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {explosiveCount=1, explosiveType="atomicRocket", target="muppet9010", accuracyRadiusMax=50})` |
| offset artillery | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {explosiveCount=1, explosiveType="artilleryShell", target="muppet9010", targetOffset={10, 10}})` |
| poison capsules in large area around spawn | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {explosiveCount=200, explosiveType="poisonCapsule", target="muppet9010", targetPosition={"x"=0,"y"=0}, accuracyRadiusMax=200})` |
| large count of explosive rockets using salvo and delay | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {delay=5, explosiveCount=30, explosiveType="explosiveRocket", target="muppet9010", accuracyRadiusMax=30, salvoSize=10, salvoDelay=300, salvoFollowPlayer=true})` |
| custom type | `/sc remote.call('muppet_streamer_v2', 'run_command', 'muppet_streamer_v2_schedule_explosive_delivery', {explosiveCount=5, explosiveType="custom", target="muppet9010", customExplosiveType="cannon-projectile", customExplosiveSpeed=1, accuracyRadiusMax=10})` |

# Notes

- Explosives will fly in from off screen to random locations around the target player within the accuracy options. They may take a few seconds to complete their delivery as they fly in using their native throwing/shooting/spitting speed. Any explosive that collides with things (i.e. tank cannon shells) may complete their damage before they reach the player.
- Weapons are on a special enemy force so that they will hurt everything on the map, `muppet_streamer_v2_enemy`. This also means that player damage upgrades don't affect these effects.
- Default projectile speeds for the built-in options: the thrown grenade & capsule, plus rocket options has a value of `0.3`. The artillery shell option has a value of `1`. Projectiles can have maximum speeds defined in their game prototypes that will constrain this effects outcomes.
- Factorio sounds require the player to be near (40 tiles?) from the entity when it starts playing a sound, otherwise they will never hear it regardless of if the player and entity come closer while the sound is still playing. This leads to any projectile sounds not being heard by the player, but they will near explosion sounds when the projectile lands near them and creates an explosion effect. However, some projectiles including vanilla Factorio spitter/worm spit has the landing sound as part of the projectile and not as part of an impact explosion, thus by default the player won't hear these. To mitigate this the `smallSpit`, `mediumSpit` and `largeSpit` use a bespoke projectile and fire (impact explosion) prototypes where the impact noise is part of the fire prototype so it can be heard by the players. Also the "in-air" sound of the spit projectiles has been removed as when this is heard en-mass it can sound like a bad static acid noise.
