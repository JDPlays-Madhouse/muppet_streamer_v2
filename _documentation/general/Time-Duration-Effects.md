At present a Time Duration Effect may interrupt a different type of Time Duration Effect, depending upon each effects behaviours and player state requirements. i.e. Aggressive Driver and Malfunctioning Weapon will interrupt each other, but a Player Drop Inventory will not affect an Aggressive Driver.

Any repeated running of the same effect will have the subsequent effect requests ignored, with the first effect continuing until its original completion.
